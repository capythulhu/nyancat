# nyancat Algorithm Runner

To run a `.nya` script with `nyancat.exe`, just run the following command, specifying a relative path to a `.nya` file without the extension:

`./nyancat foo/bar/script`

If your quantum script asks for arguments, you can provide them on the command line:

`./nyancat foo/bar/script 3 1 2 0`

For more informations about how nyancat works and how to integrate the library with C, for more detailed computations, check out the [readme file](https://github.com/thzoid/nyancat/blob/master/README.md).
